# Reddit Scraper and Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis project for self-learning and for fun. Reddit data is scraped, run through Textblob and Vader analysis and then visualized.




## Methodology

### First steps
Before creating the dataset, you will need a Reddit account in order to use the Praw library needed to scrape information from the subreddit of choice. In addition, you'll need the proper authentication tokens outlined [here](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps).

You will also need to make a `my-dataset` folder in your working directory, creating the folders `datafiles`, `imagefiles` and `textfiles` within it.

### Create Dataset
With those steps out of the way, run the following Python scripts in order to create the dataset.

- `datacompile.py` - scrapes indicated subreddit for indicated year (adjustable directly in script)

- `data_retrieve.py` - compiles raw data for indicated subreddit and year (adjusted directly in script) into csv for analysis

### Analyze dataset
After the dataset has been compiled, run the scripts to analyze the data and turn it into a visualizations.

- `analyze.py` - generates a scatterplot from Textblob analysis, saves it to imagedata (subreddit and year adjusted in script directly)
 
- `analyze2.py` - generates wordclouds and bar charts from Vader sentiment analysis

- `cloud.py` - generates a wordcloud from total scraping

The included Jupyter notebook `Reddit Scraping Project` combines the functionality of analyze.py, analyze2.py and cloud.py and can be run on its own in lieu of them.

### Limitations
- Partially completed subreddits in a folder will cause `datacompile.py` to skip over them entirely (it won't fill them up)

- Need to specify the year and subreddit for each script.
## Future Plans

- Create directory structure from code

- Refactor code with better use of functions, loops and vectorization

- Better use of object-oriented programming principles

- Add ability to specify a time range 

- Better show what's going on when the code is running, allow pausing and restarting

- More informative, possibly interactive visualizations

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm aspiring to enter into the data science, data engineering and machine learning fields. 

After some needed encouragement and some gentle nudging by thoughtful friends, I returned to college in 2017, completing a degree in physics a few years later. During that time, a good professor introduced me to the realm of machine learning and data science. Wanting to take advantage of this new cultural change, I resolved to learn what I could about these growing fields for myself. Itâ€™s been slow going with plenty of hiccups and detours in the way, but Iâ€™m still working hard on bettering myself, increasing my skillsets, and making my way to be the most robust data scientist I can be.
