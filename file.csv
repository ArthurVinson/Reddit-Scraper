PaizoCon starts tomorrow, are you ready?! I have some speculations for Pathfinder2e.. In this video I make completely unsubstantiated claims about cool things we might see get announced at this yearâ€™s PaizoCon

2,Frontline PC for supporting a witch and a warpriest in troubles in otari - which class?,0,"I DMed the beginner box for a ranger, cleric and witch. The ranger player know wants to run trouble in otari for me and the other two players with free archetype. The warpriest cleric will go champion, the baba yaga witch hasn't decided on an archetype yet, but likes alchemist. They definitely need someone on the frontline who can dish out and suck up some damage. Would you recommend a specific class for this AP?

So far I'm struggling between
 
- a reflective ripple monk focused on tripping (the witch has elemental betrayal and hydraulic push, so water strikes would have a nice synergy) with the folklorist archetype (mostly for thematic reasons, but could provide good support) 

- a primal or arcane summoner with a caster archetype (I could help flanking and assist with additional spells, but the class has some weird rules and I will probably play it wrong without the new DM noticing it)

- a straightforward polearm fighter (great damage and strong enough that I can pick a subpar archetype without looking for synergies to make the fighter less bland) 

- a druid with an animal companion (strong AoE spells, extra heals, not as fragile as other casters, but the companion will be of course rather weak compared to a martial character) and the medic or herbalist archetype

But I'm open to other suggestions too. The players had a really easy time in menace under otari, but troubles is supposed to be quite a bit harder, so I'm worried that they will struggle if I don't have an optimized charcter to protect and support them.",uycknh,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/uycknh/frontline_pc_for_supporting_a_witch_and_a/,2.0,1653585453.0,Pathfinder2e,"{'neg': 0.299, 'neu': 0.543, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': -0.3818}","{'neg': 0.188, 'neu': 0.653, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': -0.89}",

4,How does spell slot ballencing work?,1,"So, coming as a DM from 5e. I am very much aware of the power imballences between caster and martial. Right here, I am specifically talking about the issue with spell slots being a limited resource.

I feel the need to explain what I mean a little bit. 5e is designed for like 6-8 encounters bewteen each long rest. So, over the course of 6-8 encounters a caster will generally have to conserve spell slots. This seems to never happen though. Instead a caster can burn a bunch of spellslots in 2-3 encounters and massively outplay martials.

Does something similar happen in this system? I couldn't actually find any information on how much combat to have bewteen long rest and daily preparations.",uyc1oy,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/uyc1oy/how_does_spell_slot_ballencing_work/,4.0,1653584020.0,Pathfinder2e,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}","{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.941, 'pos': 0.022, 'compound': -0.2023}",

10,,3,"There's no rule or even guideline for number of encounters per day.

The way the rules are set up allow for great flexibility. You can have 3-5 encounters per day. Or even more. Or even just a single one. Each and every one of those options is perfectly fine and viable. **If** you set the difficulty for the enconters right.

Don't throw 5 severe encounters at your party. For that number of fights, each one should be a low or moderate threat. Likewise, if you do only a single fight in a day, you probably want it to be hard or even severe. Do NOT throw extreme encounters at your party unless you want to get someone killed. Extreme encounters are brutal.

Which brings me to the main difference between 5e and PF2 when it comes to GM-ing. The encounter building actually works. If you follow the rules and create a severe threat encounter, it will be an actual severe threat. You can trust the system 9.9 times out of ten. The remaining 0.1 are encounters in which either the party or the opposition has a tactical advantage that isn't reflected in their actual levels.

11,,1,"Martials & casters are much better balanced in this game, so you won't see too much of that imbalance you are talking about from 5e.  
Casters still have to manage thier spell slots over the course of a day, but thier spells are less powerful when compared to 5e spells.  

Thanks to medicine/treat wounds & focus spells, you can usually have plenty of encounters before running out of resources, though this really only applies aftrr the first few levels.  The level of encounter chosen by the gm plays into this, also.  Typically moderate and above encounters will make players use more resources, while lower level encounters will be easy to win without consuming spell slots or 1x/daily abilities.",uyc1oy,ia36fcl,,,1653585110.0,Pathfinder2e,,,"{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9634}"
