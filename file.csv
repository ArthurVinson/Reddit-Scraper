0,The problem of analogical predication and the threat of Christian atheism,1,"So I have noticed a problem as of late.   


Most major old churches, catholic, reformed, Lutheran etc. affirm a doctrine called analogical predication, which denies univocal predication   


This means words that literally apply to God and creatures don't assert the same facts.   


For example   


""God knows Herod killed children "" means something other than ""God knows(1) Herod killed children""   


knows(1) is the creaturely usage of the word, it attributes the property of knowledge to God.   


The assertion ""God knows(1) Herod killed children"" would mean the speaker is denying divine simplicity since knows(1) is a property distinct from the property holder .  


The only things that can have the property of knowledge(1) are ontologically complex.   


So here is the problem, atheism is defined as the denial that ""Gods"" exist.  


""Gods"" is a word that means something.   


Gods in the sense of atheism are minds(1), meaning the word mind is used in the same sense you would apply a mind to President Trump.   


Atheism doesn't comment on the existence of non-univocal ""divine minds"", in fact it saying God doesnt have mind(1) essentially just concedes to the atheist the very position he desires.   


Moreover there is worse problem.   


if God doesn't have ""properties(1)"" then he must have something else.   


However you cannot just leave it at ""something else""   


If all you can say is God has some unknown thing called ""all knowledge, all loving etc"" then you don't actually know what a God is.   


Essentially the words ""all knowing, all loving, etc."" function now as placeholders for some idea.   


Just like ""God is X,Y,Z""  


X,Y, and Z are place holders for content not content themselves.   


If one cannot actually place anything in those slots then the sentence ""God is X,Y,Z"" is meaningless.   


Its not apparent any intelligible response someone who denies univocal predicates could put in those slots.   


This creates a dilemma  


If we say God doesn't have univocal properties the atheist isnt defeated  


If we say God has nonunivocal properties but can't identify what they are the word God is undefined.   


I post this because until recently I thought the theistic personalist definition of God was new.   


However upon beginning to read old school atheist literature and theist literature that interacted with atheism it has become apparent that what i posted above is a long standing atheist complaint.   


Baron d'Holbach  8 December 1723 – 21 January 178  (atheist)  argued the above.   


 [Anthony Collins (philosopher)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Collins_(philosopher)) (1676–1729) (deist) argued the above  


 **George Berkeley** (12 March 1685 – 14 January 1753)  (Christian, Anglican) wrote a book where he had a mouth piece character for himself debate a hypothetical atheist arguing the above   


It has therefore become apparent that apologetics mostly consists of two sorts  


Theistic personalists arguing correctly that if there position is true atheism is false   


Classical theists arguing incorrectly that if there right atheism is false.",tuvf45,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/tuvf45/the_problem_of_analogical_predication_and_the/,0.0,1648939493.0,Reformed
1,soChristian Love Over 50+?,4,"This is a very interesting question I have and I'm posting it here because it has to do with dating/courting as an older believer. So backstory is my father passed away October 2020. He passed just a month shy of my parent's 26th wedding anniversary. Both were strong believers and raised me and my brother in the Godly path. My dad sadly was a struggling alcoholic who relapsed many, many times throughout their life together. Despite his many failings and shortcomings I know that he truly tried his very best to love us as a family. 

Now that he has since passed I have wondered if one day my mother will end up remarrying. I to be 100% honest would LOVE that. My mother is truly a superhero in my eyes and she deserves to find love again and be happy. I decided to speak about it casually with her a couple weeks ago and she pretty much said that she doesn't want to be with anyone again. However knowing my mom I could read in between the lines. We are all still grieving and she has a long way to go in being healed from MUCH pain, and grief that my father caused her. But regardless I still could tell that she may want to try again in the future but she's scared and has her guard up. 

So my question is this. Does anyone know of any older Christians (be they family or friends) that have found love and gotten married again after death of a spouse? Is there anyone who is that person who God blessed them with a wonderful partner? Would love to hear about it. Thank you 😊",tuu87d,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/tuu87d/sochristian_love_over_50/,1.0,1648936210.0,Reformed

3,Will we EVER see God's face?,3,"  
We're all looking forward to seeing Jesus, but what about the Father? 

I'm certain we'll never be disappointed in eternity with whatever God grants... but I struggle to see myself ever ""sitting on dad's lap"".   
The clearest scripture to me is Paul saying...  
*Timothy 6:16ESV ►who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.*  


Is ""can see"" both present and future tense?  
I think language rules say so. The NLT translators think so.  
*He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No human eye has ever seen him, nor ever will. All honor and power to him forever! Amen. Timothy 6:16NLT*

28,,5,"Important text:

>their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven (Matthew 18:10)

This has gotten different interpretations throughout church history. Surely the Father is not incarnate and so does not have a literal human face? And do angels see with literal eyes? Does this mean a blessed intellectual apprehension of who God is? Other interpretations insist our physical eyes will be miraculously enabled to see God - though maybe as light, not as a human figure. 

I get real nervous here about endorsing a solution because it seems easy to slip into doctrine of God heresy. I certainly don't think the Father has a body, and I also worry about saying that we can perceive God's essence, which should be impossible for a creature. But then, ""We will see him as he is"" (1 John 3:2) is quite a strong statement! Hard to know what that means, but maybe that is the point? We will know what it means when we get there! It will be higher than any experience of God we have had here.

Revelation seems to juxtapose God and Jesus in complicated ways. At one point, it says that the glory of God will be the light, but the Lamb will be the lamp (Rev. 21:23). I take this to mean that the risen body of Christ will still be the focal point of the vision of God. But Christ will be fully visibly glorified in a way he wasn't here on earth, except maybe at the transfiguration.

I guess my reason for not seeing an ""intimate"" moment with the Father lies in the fact that he never changes - thus he's ALWAYS beyond our grasp. ALWAYS dwelling in unapproachable light.

I think you’re asking the right questions, but you’re in the “hard outer shell” part of a sweet candy, if I can put it that way.

41,,2,"Well that is the key. But I think the distinction is that when we finally enter into the city of God, we will experience the Trinity (in Christ) completely, seeing God with no obstruction, nothing hidden. I haven’t done a full study yet, but here are some additional Scripture and resources I’ve found.

It appears that our foreheads will bear the names of both the Lamb and the Father:

**Revelation 14:1**

>Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.

Furthermore, we have this promise of “seeing face-to-face” in a way that was not previously possible; the apostles of course had already seen Jesus face-to-face, and all believers will see Him when He descends from heaven. So there is a further “face-to-face” vision beyond that.

**1 Corinthians 13:12**

>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.

For my quick, go-to commentaries, Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown believe Rev. 22:4 is only about seeing the Father in Jesus, not directly, while the ESV Study Bible emphasizes the totality of God that will be seen. Other older commentaries in the Reformed tradition, that I can access free online, also leave it as “seeing God” rather than differentiating between the Son and the Father. Frustratingly, the Reformation Study Bible skips this verse! Ligonier and DesiringGod also talk about seeing God through Christ.

And that’s ultimately the key thing. We may get hung up on our conceptions of “seeing.” I think the point of Scripture is that because of Christ and in Christ, nothing of the Father will be hidden from us. The Father will not have a physical body, but we will still be experiencing Him fully. In Christ...but not as though Christ were a veil between us and the Father to hide some of the Father from us. Maybe I’ll understand this all better later.

Now, I have no problem saying you could hug Jesus in his human nature - but whether the Father could “assume” a human nature the way Christ did? - that’s a trickier question. I see two paths one could take:

1. “No”, because “incarnation” is intrinsically tied to the “of-ness” of the son within the opera ad extra of the Trinity

2. “Kind of” - since Jesus is of one essence with the father, he is “present” in the incarnation, just not in the same way the father is (the topic is called the “inseparable operations of the Trinity, and is more complicated than a Reddit comment is built for)",tun503,i352rdu,,,1648927055.0,Reformed

I can understand there being a fear that maybe something could feasibly happen to the sub where it becomes not as good as it used to or even has some major failing in leadership. But something like that would probably require a long sort of decay. It's a *little* uncharitable to the mods to take at face value that they would actually sell out with no warning all at once on today of all days. But maybe these feelings speak more to just how important online communities have become nowadays. Perhaps it's best that we breathe a sigh of relief and thank God we have pretty normal and good mods who wouldn't actually do anything so off the wall. :)

I saw the event as the sub putting on some clown makeup and a red rubber nose and then acting out someone else for the day. I didn't think the joke was opaque, but maybe I am missing some perspective. I actually very much dislike most comedians nowadays, and the ones I like still have problems with them to the point where I know it's not great to consume their material.

Buddy if a subreddit getting a sponsor made you think that every man has a price and caused you to stumble for a whole day, you should probably delete your account and get some fresh air.

In Christ’s parable a sower didn’t literally sow seeds on four different soils. At least not necessarily.
