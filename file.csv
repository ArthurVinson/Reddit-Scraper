2,Spellcaster into Martial multiclass - is it viable?,11,"Probably one of the most common questions about P2E, but, oh, well...

It just looks a bit weird how fighter archetype is the only one that can raise weapon proficiency. And the champion is the only that can raise armor proficiency. Contrary to spellcaster archetypes that give any martial character an option to go as far as master spellcasting proficiency with no exception whatsoever

Not that I'm bashing on the latter. On the contrary, I think having master in spellcasting is pretty much a baseline for offensive spells. But the former on the other hand... Is there a particular design idea behind it? Or does it even matter?

The vast rift between Fighter/Wizard and Wizard/Fighter is a great example, I reckon. FIghter's martial capabilities are pretty much unhindered by taking Wizard archetype, and master spellcasting with up to level 8 spells is just great. Wizard on the other hand is very good with spells and Fighter archetype... What does Wizard get from Fighter archetype exactly? Trained at most weapon and fighter DC at level 2 and expert at most weapons at level 12?

I just don't get why would you go for martial archetypes as a spellcaster... It's not like you could spoil a character with bad feats, simply because most classes have very solid chassis.

Same numbers, different equipment.

Hypothetically you *could* make a Wizard that starts with 16 Str and takes Fighter and Champion archetype feats, but you'll reach at most a +6 modifier with no more than expert proficiency in weapons or armor. That puts you -2 behind the Fighter's AC even in full-plate and -3 behind any non-Fighter martial character's attack rolls, on top of dealing -5 damage per hit from the lack of Greater Weapon Specialization and the lowered Strength and proficiency. You would have up to 10th level spell slots and 4 spells per level through that range that you could use to buff yourself, but a Fighter with a Wizard archetype could've gotten most of those anyway. Or the Wizard in the party could've cast those spells on the Fighter.

Notably though, taking the Champion archetype feats for heavy armor DOES increase your maximum possible AC by 1. Additionally, though the Fighter's offensive feats won't be of use to a Wizard as their spells are their means of offense, a Wizard could use Reactive Shield and/or Quick Shield Block to makes themselves substantially more survivable while running up to cast Burning Hands into a big pack of enemies.

Others have given good advice, particularly in regards to going for options other than strikes but one thing to consider as well is utilising weapon strikes alongside spells. If you cast a spell that doesn't require an attack roll, you can still strike with a weapon at no MAP. Your chance to hit will still be pretty decent, probably no worse than a martial at their first -5 increment assuming you're at least using a non-dump stat weapon. It's not a bad idea to pick up something like a crossbow or even spec into the archery archetype, particularly if you're struggling to find anything to do with your third action other than just move around.

Essentially, just don't go in expecting that a wizard spec'd with armor and weapon buffs will be equivalent to a full progression martial.

19,,4,"> There are some vocal folks that will talk about +2 to hit or a difference in AC and HP as if that's the difference between functionally and unplayable

This is true. If being trained vs. expert in attacks made casters useless at strikes then every martial would be useless compared to fighter, but clearly this isn't the case.

A caster will never be *better* at martial combat than a martial. Buff spells can help, but no buff will fully bridge that (except maybe magic weapon at 1-3). They can, however, be decent enough to have martial combat as a decent secondary option.

The biggest challenge I've found for making a caster/martial hybrid is in items, not core capabilities. Martials generally spend a huge amount of their gear budget on magic weapons, whereas casters use that same budget to get staves, wands, and scrolls for more spell slot options. To me the biggest cost a full caster has from going to a martial dedication is the loss or splitting of gear between two very different equipment strategies.

>""but it'd be even better if you cast those spells on an actual martial"" argument isn't relevant because we're not aiming for the best possible scenario; we're aiming at viable.

While true, this is sort of a strawman of the argument, which is that casters are not *better* at martial combat than actual martials, even using spells, and that such spells are even more powerful if used to buff martials. But if nobody wanted to play a martial you could absolutely survive using dedications and spells, you may just have to rest a bit more frequently. Just as a party of all martials is viable, but will generally be weaker than one with at least one caster, if not a 50/50 split.

All those issues aside, I think martial dedications can work well for casters, especially ones that add decent ranged options. The ""cantrip + bow shot"" turn gives casters a much more consistent damage option than one without the bow, and I really enjoyed one of my sorcerers that took monk dedication with the archer stance and eventually picked up flurry for cast + strike + strike. But I also think there are a lot of class feats for sorcerer that are not particularly powerful.

The biggest downside to this character was keeping up with runes, and I found I frequently had to wait a level or two behind the ""optimal"" upgrade path and had to sacrifice staves due to the action economy. But it was fun.

Another common one is champion, which is a fantastic caster dedication, although I haven't played one myself. But the heavy armor access is amazing (and the delayed proficiency doesn't really affect casters much) and most of the champion features you can gain are at max effectiveness and use either reactions or single actions, both of which casters can struggle to find good uses for.

It also depends on the caster type; bards, druids, oracles, and clerics tend to have strong martial multiclass options, whereas sorcerers, witches, and wizards tend to be a bit more dicey from my observation, especially for melee. I wouldn't put any of these in the ""unplayable"" category, though.",up7y3v,i8jd1d4,,,1652499594.0,Pathfinder2e,,,"{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9909}"

Most notably, the weapon should be held, meaning you can't take out a greatsword with one hand and send it to attack while having a shield in other. Plus, it deals damage as if you had hit a target with a melee Strike. That means 1.5 handed weapons like staves deal the least amount of damage

Master with Spells and Master with Weapons aren't equivalent.
