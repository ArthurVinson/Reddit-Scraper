Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist,5,"Hello all,

First and foremost I want to humbly ask for those who read this to please pray for me as I face all sorts of confusion and anxiety with this topic.

I was raised Catholic all my life and come from a very Catholic extended family. I have a cousin who is in the process of becoming a nun and another who will soon be entering the priesthood. I also have a Catholic deacon in my family, an uncle, who knows that I have left ""the Church"" and am Protestant in my beliefs. (I also add that I am very much Reformed in my theology)

This deacon uncle of mine lovingly pulled me aside the other day and explained to me that the Catholic Church, though having its mishaps and dark times, is the One True Church established by Jesus Christ. He made it a point to explain to me that Jesus is really, physically present in the Eucharist and that because he loves me as his nephew, he ""would not want to die"" before at least telling me what I am missing. I love my Catholic family very much and I can see why it is that they find it so important to bring me back to the Catholic church if possible.

For the past couple days I have earnestly been listening/watching debates, literature, and sermons regarding the view of the Lord's Supper. Everywhere I look I find numerous writings from Church Fathers that believed in the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. Why is this? It's all driving me a bit crazy.

I believe in Jesus Christ as the Lord and Savior who died for the sins of all those who would believe in His name. I have been a Christian for about a year and a half. I have tasted and seen the working of the Holy Spirit in my life. I do not understand why this topic of the Eucharist can make my faith weary.

 I hope that some of you on this sub can speak to the questions I have. If not, I ask that you pray for my faith to strengthened. God bless.",m0x281,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/m0x281/presence_of_jesus_christ_in_the_eucharist/
How is 'Reformed' specifically different from just 'Protestant'?,2,"When I think 'Reformed' I think of Christian theology that is the outcome of the reformation and after. Is there something specific about 'reformed theology' that is more specific than being just protestant theology? Where are the boundaries of what counts as reformed? This seems to me to be like the question of what states are in the Midwest or the South; there some states for which the regional designation is clear, and others which are debatable. What denominations and movements are clearly reformed, and which are debatable?",m0wf4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/m0wf4t/how_is_reformed_specifically_different_from_just/

Critical Race Theory,0,"This podcast has blown me out of the water with what I thought about BLM and CRT. Man these guys know their stuff. This is 4 hours long but is exhaustive, not tons of academia terminology.


Edited to include tl;dr, systematically reviews Critical Race Theory, roots, looks at the tenets of CRT/BLM and then ultimately why it is opposed to Christianity and Basic Rational by removing the right to test its ideologies and objectively look at it by different means. This is a poor summary and if you have free time to throw it on in the back ground I highly recommend it. I have changed my whole point view from BLM being a good idea but bad means to repenting because it tries to create a truth apart from Christ. There can be no repentance or reconciliation with God or others about from the one true way.

"Progressive and/or liberal Christianity? What exactly is it, and is it ALL bad?",10,"I hear terms like “progressive Christianity” a lot, but what exactly is it? Is it more of a theological term, or a political term?

Obviously the belief that homosexually is ok is unbiblical, but would this be a “liberal” or a “progressive” viewpoint?

What about if someone thinks LGBT people should still have full and equal rights under the law, but that homosexuality is still a sin? Is that viewpoint still “progressive Christianity”?

Or what about economic views - left wing economic ideas like the welfare state, universal healthcare, etc are “progressive” politically, but would a Christian believing in those things make them a “progressive Christian” too, or is this a different “progressive” than the kind of progressive that believes homosexuality isn’t sinful?",m0pqdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reformed/comments/m0pqdb/progressive_andor_liberal_christianity_what/
Prayer/Encouragment for new church,10,"I've recently decided I'm probably going to leave me non-denomenational church. There's a lot of works based teaching and looking at self instead of the gospel and looking to Christ, and honestly after delving into reformed theology I can't unsee these things. I've visited a reformed Church close to me where the word is faithfully preached (from what I've heard so far), which is my number one priority, but don't know if I'll stay there just because it's mostly families and older folk and there's not really anybody my age (I'm 20). This of course isn't the end all be all if there's nobody my age but before I started looking I made myself make sure I looked at more then one church since there are many options available in my area (Calgary Alberta). Also a side not but it'll definitely take a bit of time to get used to hymns, coming from full band worship hahaha.

I guess I'm just asking for prayers that the Lord will guide me to a good church, which I'm sure he will I guess I need to trust that more. Along with some of the pain that is present when it comes to leaving a church as well. It really feels like your striking it out on your own when it comes to the church hunt, and I'll be honest it's kind of a lonely time.
If anyone could offer any encouragements that would be more than welcome, I feel overwhelmed about this often and it stress me out... I know that although this process might be hard it'll be worth it, but man it doesn't stop the pain and stress that comes in the moment

Thanks for reading this I know it's kinda long

Unreached People Group of the Week - Central Kurds in Iraq,12,"Iraq was on my mind today so meet the **Central Kurds of Iraq**!

# Region: Iraq - Iraqi Kurdistan

https://preview.redd.it/nphmzx36wtl61.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb756eb7b112025bbea986f3233976fcc9a5d790

**Climate:** Iraq has a hot, dry climate characterized by long, hot, dry summers and short, cool winters. The climate is influenced by Iraq's location between the subtropical aridity of the Arabian desert areas and the subtropical humidity of the Persian Gulf. January is the coldest month, with temperatures from 5°C to 10°C, and August is the hottest month with temperatures rising up to 30°C and more.

In most of the areas, summers are warm to hot with mostly sunshine, but high humidity on the southern coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. Daily Temperatures can be very hot; on some days temperatures can reach easily 45°C or more, especially in the Iraqi desert areas which causes a danger of heat exhaustion. Hot, dry desert winds can be very strong sometimes, and can cause violent sandstorms.

About 70 percent of the average rainfall in the country falls between November and March; June through August are often rainless. Rainfall varies from season to season and from year to year. Precipitation is sometimes concentrated in local, but violent storms, causing erosion and local flooding, especially in the winter months.

However, the mountainous regions of northern Iraq can be classified as Dsa Climate, a cold snow Climate with dry summers and wet winters with the warmest month over 22°C and the coldest month below -3°C.

**Terrain:** The geography of Iraq is diverse and falls into five main regions: the desert (west of the Euphrates), Upper Mesopotamia (between the upper Tigris and Euphrates rivers), the northern highlands of Iraq, Lower Mesopotamia, and the alluvial plain extending from around Tikrit to the Persian Gulf.

Southern Kurdistan is largely mountainous, with the highest point being a 3,611 m (11,847 ft) point known locally as Cheekha Dar (""black tent""). Mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan include the Zagros, Sinjar Mountains, Hamrin Mountains, Mount Nisir and Qandil mountains. There are many rivers running through the region, which is distinguished by its fertile lands, plentiful water, and picturesque nature. The Great Zab and the Little Zab flow east-west in the region. The Tigris river enters Iraqi Kurdistan from Turkish Kurdistan.

The mountainous nature of Iraqi Kurdistan, the difference of temperatures in its various parts, and its wealth of waters make it a land of agriculture and tourism. The largest lake in the region is Lake Dukan. There are also several smaller lakes, such as Darbandikhan Lake and Duhok Lake. The western and southern parts of Iraqi Kurdistan are not as mountainous as the east. Instead, it is rolling hills and plains vegetated by sclerophyll scrubland.

**Environmental Issues:** Iraq faces serious environmental problems, ranging from poor **water** quality, soil salinity, air pollution, and conflict pollution to the deterioration of key ecosystems, climate change impacts and threat of water shortages

**Languages:** Arabic, Kurdish, Mesopotamian Arabic, Syriac-Aramaic, Neo-Aramaic languages, Armenian, Turkish (Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman dialects), Persian

**Government Type:** Federal parliamentary constitutional republic

The 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum took place on September 25, with 92.73% voting in favor of independence. This triggered a military operation in which the Iraqi government retook control of Kirkuk and surrounding areas, and forced the KRG to annul the referendum.

# People: Central Kurds in Iraq

**Population:** 4,652,000 in Iraq

**Beliefs:** The Central Kurds of Iraq are only 0.05% Christian. That means out of every 2000, there is only one believer. Out of their population, there are likely only around 2000 believers. 

Before the spread of Islam, many Kurds were followers of Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, or local pagan beliefs. Kurds were assimilating these religious practices into their cultural domain as early as 800 BCE. Arab conquests, however, began in the seventh century AD, eventually overpowering Kurdish resistance. Over time, Sunni Islam became the dominant religion of the Kurdish people, following the Shafi school. There is a very small minority Shia population, who live in central and south-eastern Iraq. Though Islam is thought to be a religion of governance as well as spirituality, Kurds made sure to keep spiritual identity separate from national identity. Today, many Muslim Kurds do not consider themselves particularly religious when it comes to adhering to the call to prayer five times a day, but secondary practices of Islam have a stronghold in Kurdish culture. Following Islamic food restrictions, refraining from the consumption of alcohol, circumcising male newborns, and wearing a veil are all very popular customs among Kurds.

It has been said that Kurds ""hold their Islam lightly"", meaning that they are not so strongly committed to Islam, and do not identify as closely with it as Arabs do. This is perhaps due to several factors, one being that many Kurds still feel some connection with the ancient Zoroastrian faith, and they feel it is an original Kurdish spirituality that far predates the seventh century AD arrival of Muhammad. Nonetheless, most Kurds are Muslims, and today about three quarters are members of the majority Sunni branch (at least nominally). As many as four million Kurds are Shiite Muslims, living mostly in Iran where the Shiite faith is predominant.

**History:** According to Michael M. Gunter, the origin of Kurds is uncertain, but it is thought by some scholars that Kurds might be the descendants of various Indo-European tribes that arrived in the region about 4,000 years ago.Arabs applied the name ""Kurds"" to the people of the mountains after they had conquered and Islamicized the region. In the 1500s most Kurds fell under Ottoman Rule. Iraqi Kurds developed as a subgroup of the Kurdish peoples when Great Britain created the state of Iraq out of the Sykes–Picot Agreement of World War I. The Kurdish people were expecting to soon gain independence from what they were promised in the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920, but this was quickly overturned in 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne established the Republic of Turkey over Kurdistan's borders.

In 1946 the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) was founded by Mulla Mustafa Barzani which pushed for Kurdish autonomy under the Iraqi government. In the year 1958 Abdul Karim Qasim made a coup against the British and the Republic of Iraq was established. The Kurds had hoped that now they would receive their promised rights, but the political environment was not favorable. So the KDP began an insurgency against the Government in Baghdad in 1961. Their insurgency was in part successful as in 1966 official Kurdish groups gained some rights with the Bazzaz Declaration and with the 1970 Peace Accord a principle of Kurdish autonomy was reached. In the 1970 Peace Accord, Kurdish cultural, social and political rights were recognised within fifteen points. But these rights were not implemented due to the willingness of the Arabs but rather because of political developments. Nevertheless, the Kurds had a period of greater liberty from 1970 to 1974. But in March 1975 the Iraq and Iran reached an agreement and within a few hours after the agreement, Iran stopped all support to the KDP, whose members and their families had the choice between go to exile to Iran or surrender to the Iraqi authority. Most KDP members chose to live in exile and the KDP declared the end of their insurgency.  Therefore, in 1975, another political party emerged in Iraqi Kurdistan, led by Jalal Talabani—the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Since the PUK was established, it lacked cooperation and engaged in violent conflict with the KDP over differing philosophies, demographics, and goals. From March 1987 until 1989 the Anfal campaign lasted, with which the Kurds were supposed to be arabized. During the Anfal campaign the Iraqi military attacked about 250 Kurdish villages with chemical weapons and destroyed Kurdish 4500 villages and evicted its inhabitants. The campaign culminated in the Halabja massacre in March 1988.

After the Gulf War and an unsuccessful Kurdish uprising in 1991, Kurds fled back to the mountains to seek refuge from the Hussein regime.  The United States established a safe-haven and no fly zone initiative in Iraqi Kurdistan for the Kurds in order for them to develop an asylum away from the Hussein regime. United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 in 1991 condemned and forbade ""the repression of the Iraqi civilian population... in Kurdish populated areas."" After many bloody encounters, an uneasy balance of power was reached between the Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops, ultimately allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function independently. The region continued to be ruled by the KDP and PUK and began to establish a stable economy and national identity. Iraqi Kurdistan built a socioeconomic infrastructure from scratch, completely independent from the centralized framework for the Baath regime. Though civil war broke out in the north between Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan from 1994 to 1998, Kurds were still able to maintain a democratic and prosperous foundation for their region.

Article 140 of the 2005 Iraqi constitution vowed to place disputed areas under the jurisdiction of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) by the end of 2007. The three phases that were going to aid this process were normalization, census, and referendum. The normalization phase was supposed to undo the 'Arabization' policies Kurds faced from 1968 to 2003 that were designed to alter the demographic in the city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas to favor the Arab population. These policies included deportation, displacement, house demolition, and property confiscation. Institutionalized boundaries as a result of past gerrymandering were also to be reversed. After this normalization process, a census would talk place and the populous would choose to be governed by either the KRG or Baghdad.

Article 140 was not implemented by 2007. At this time the Presidency Council also recommended to reattach all previously detached districts of Kirkuk. The Chemchamal and Kalar districts that were allocated to Sulaymaniyah Governorate in 1976 were to be returned to Kirkuk. Kifri, annexed to the Diyala governorate in 1976 was to be reattached, although it had been under Kurdish control since 1991. Lastly, the Tuz district would be reattached from the Salah ad-Din district. In 2008, the 140 Committee announced inaction on these initiatives.

In 2008, the Iraqi, Kurdish and US governments came to the consensus that these types of reparations to the Kurdish people would not be able to be carried out without further negotiations and political agreements on boundaries. The US government faced many problems trying to implement Article 140. This was not an ideal form of reparation for many Kurds. After being displaced, many formerly Kurdish regions lacked in development and agricultural upkeep. Educational and economic opportunities were often greater for Kurds outside of these disputed territories, so many people did not want to be forced to return.

During the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, Iraqi Kurdistan seized the city of Kirkuk and the surrounding area, as well as most of the disputed territories in Northern Iraq.

**Culture:** *Typical qualification that all people groups can't be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization.*

Kurdish culture is a group of distinctive cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from the various ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society, but primarily Iranian. Among their neighbours, the Kurdish culture is closest to Persian culture. For example, they celebrate Newroz as the new year day, which is celebrated on March 21. It is the first day of the month of *Xakelêwe* in Kurdish calendar and the first day of spring.

Kurdish folk music is an important part of Kurdish culture and has traditionally been used to transmit stories about Kurdish history by Dengbêj (bards). According to thekurdishproject.org, 'The word ‘deng’ means voice and ‘bej’ means ‘to sing.’

Food is widely recognised to be a fundamental part of what it means to be Kurdish. Foods such as Dolma (rice stuffed in grape leaves), kfta (spiced minced meat cased in thin layer of mashed pudding rice), Ser u pe (goats head, tongue and feet), shifta (meat patties), are traditional Kurdish foods. Lamb and chicken have been staple meats in Kurdish cuisine for centuries. Vegetables, pilaf and dairy products also comprise a large portion of traditional Kurdish food. Tea is also staple to a Kurdish diet. It is commonly drunk 2-3 times a day, commonly a social activity. Kurds also drink Mastaw/Do'h/Ayran, a yogurt-based drink.

Kurdish society consists mainly of tribes that arose from a nomadic and semi-nomadic way of life in previous centuries. It is strongly fragmented and is often split by internal disagreements. So far in history, the Kurds have never really managed to unite in their common cause. Their primary loyalty is to the immediate family, and then to the tribe. Tribe allegiance is, however, based on a mixture of kinship and territorial loyalty. Many Kurds of the lower regions are not organized in tribes, but even there, strife is common between the different clans and communities.

The Kurds of Iraq live along the country's northeastern borders with Turkey and Iran. Most are farmers and all but a few thousand have given up the semi-nomadic lifestyle of the past in favor of settled farming. The Kurds of Iraq form nearly one third of the Iraqi population.

After having given their support to Iran in the war against Iraq in 1980, the Kurds experienced Saddam Hussein's terrible revenge, with the Iraqi government declaring war against the Kurds. This war would be known as ""al-Anfal"" (""The Spoils""), a reference to the eighth sura of the Qur'an, which details revelations that the Prophet Muhammad received after the first great victory of Islamic forces in AD 624. ""I shall cast into the unbelievers' hearts terror,"" reads one of the verses; ""so smite above the necks, and smite every finger of them ... The chastisement of the Fire is for the unbelievers.""

# Prayer Request:

* Ask the Lord protect the Kurds.
* Ask that, despite the tragedies happening with them, the Lord use this crises to bring them to Him.
* Ask the Lord to call people who are willing to go to Iraq and share Christ with the Kurds.
* Pray that God will supply clean water for the Kurds.
* Ask the Lord to raise up Christian medical teams who can take supplies and expertise to the Kurds.
* Ask God to encourage and protect the small number of Kurdish Christians.
* Ask the Holy Spirit to soften their hearts towards Christians so that they will be receptive to the Gospel.
* Pray that God will open the hearts of Iraq's governmental leaders to the Gospel.
* Ask the Lord to raise up a strong local church among the Kurds.
* Pray for our nation (the United States), that we Christians can learn to come alongside our hurting brothers and sisters and learn to carry one another's burdens in a more Christlike manner than we have done historically.
* Pray that in this time of chaos and panic that the needs of the unreached are not forgotten by the church. Pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the Good News.

*Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)*
